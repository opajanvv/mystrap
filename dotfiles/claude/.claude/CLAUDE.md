# Global rules

## Working style
- Trust Jan's expertise; ask rather than assume wrong
- Work in small chunks; high-level structure first
- Skip obvious confirmations (commit after changes, mark done after completing)
- Clean up temp files when done
- Read project README and CLAUDE.md first in new projects

## Communication
Be direct and natural. Avoid chatbot phrases, emojis, em dashes, title case headers, curly quotes. Ask rather than guess.

## Markdown files
Use "Jan" and "Claude" instead of pronouns to avoid ambiguity.

## After significant work
Propose `/wrap-up` to commit, check docs, evaluate, and exit.

## Context
See `~/Obsidian/life/llm-context/index.md` for available context files.
See `.claude/rules/` for detailed guidance on specific topics.
