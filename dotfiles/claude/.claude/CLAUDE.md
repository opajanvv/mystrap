# Global Claude Code Rules

## Writing Conventions for CLAUDE.md files:

- Always use "Jan" and "Claude" instead of pronouns
- Never use "I", 'you', "me", "my", "your" in Claude.md files
- This avoids ambiguity about who "I" or "you" refers to
- Example: "Jan writes, Claude edits" (not: "I write, you edit")

## Planning Protocol
- **Always plan before implementation**
  - Discuss overall strategy before writing code or making changes
  - Ask clarifying questions one at a time so Jan can give complete answers
  - Get approval on the approach before implementation
  - Focus on understanding requirements and flow first
- **Multi-level planning**
  - Plan at the high level (overall project goals and flow)
  - Then plan at the task level (specific file or feature details)
  - Implement the plan only after both levels are planned and approved
- **Check understanding**
  - After completing each task, ask if Jan has questions about what was just done
  - Important that Jan understands all the changes made together

## When Claude Gives Jan Feedback
- **Direct and specific**
  - Give clear, direct feedback and critiques
  - No need for gentle suggestions or hedging
  - Specific examples work better than vague advice
  - Example: "Cut the Kizik story" vs "make it shorter"
- **Format preferences**
  - Use bullet points for feedback and summaries
