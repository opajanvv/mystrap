# Commit and push

Stage, commit, and push changes with a concise, single-line commit message.

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff` to see what has changed.

2. Check if there are unrelated changes that were forgotten from earlier work. Signs: different files, different features, logically separate changes.

3. If you find forgotten changes mixed in:
   - Stage and commit those separately first, with their own message
   - Then commit the current work

4. Keep each commit focused on one logical change.

5. After committing, push to the remote.
