# Plan

Plan before implementing. Use this command to start any feature, script, refactor, or project.

## Instructions

1. **Clarify the goal**: Ask questions if anything is unclear. Don't assume. Ask one question at a time so Jan can give complete answers.

2. **Explore first**: Look at relevant code, configs, or docs to understand the current state.

3. **Plan high-level**: Outline the approach in broad strokes. What components are involved? What's the strategy?

4. **Break into tasks**: List concrete steps. Each step should be small enough to verify.

5. **Get approval**: Present the plan to Jan before implementing. Wait for feedback.

6. **Then implement**: Only after approval, start working through the tasks.

## Examples

- `/plan to add user authentication` - Explore auth options, outline the flow, list files to create/modify
- `/plan to write a backup script for docker volumes` - Clarify what to back up, where to store, how often, then outline the script
- `/plan to refactor the API layer` - Map current structure, propose new structure, list migration steps
