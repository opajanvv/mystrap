# Wrap up

End a phase, feature, or project with a clean handoff.

## Instructions

Run these steps in order:

1. **Commit current work**: Run `/commit-and-push` to commit any pending changes from the work just completed.

2. **Documentation check**: Review if any documentation needs updating based on the work done (READMEs, docs, context files). Update if needed.

3. **Evaluate**: Run the evaluate skill to review what happened, capture learnings, and propose improvements to CLAUDE.md instructions.

4. **Commit improvements**: After evaluation changes are made, run `/commit-and-push` again to commit any instruction updates.

5. **Exit**: End the session. The work is wrapped up and ready for next time.

If any step has nothing to do (no changes to commit, no improvements to make), skip it and move on.
